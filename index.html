	<p class="col-5 col-offset-4">I found a love for me <br>
		Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead<br>
		I found a girl, beautiful and sweet <br>
		I never knew you were the someone waiting for me<br>
	</p>
	<p class="col-5 col-offset-4">Cause we were just kids when we fell in love <br>
		Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this time <br>
		But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own <br>
		And in your eyes you’re holding mine<br>
	</p>
	<p class="col-5 col-offset-4">Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms <br>
		Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song <br>
		When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath <br>
		<strong>But</strong>you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight</p>
